    shortBio: "Youth leader from conflict-affected area. Climate Accountability Intern at Yankari Game Reserve, serves with CACPE.",
    fullBio: "Iliya Muhammad Makinta is a youth leader and climate justice advocate from Damaturu, Yobe State, an area deeply affected by the Boko Haram insurgency and the environmental crisis of Lake Chad. As displaced communities fled to Lake Chad's shores in search of safety, the lake's already fragile ecosystem became overwhelmed, contributing to dwindling water resources and growing insecurity across the Timbuktu Triangle.\n\nWith experience as a Climate Accountability Intern at Yankari Game Reserve, Iliya played a pivotal role in bridging trust between local communities and conservation authorities. Through campaigns and a 'Catch Them Young' initiative, he educated youth on the value of ecotourism and inclusive environmental management. He has also received capacity-building training from the FAO and the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nIliya participated in the GLF Africa 2022 Digital Conference and currently serves with the Civil Alliance for Climate Protection and Education (CACPE).\n\nHis motivation for joining the Lake Chad Climate Justice Youth Fellowship stems from a commitment to turning lived experience into leadership. He hopes to strengthen his advocacy skills, co-create climate solutions, and champion a resilient and just future for the Lake Chad basin through collaboration and community-driven action."

    fullBio: "Shola Rafiat Sule is a climate justice advocate from Biu, Borno State an area transformed into a refuge for displaced persons fleeing conflict from Baga, Chibok, and Maiduguri. This influx has stretched local resources, driven up living costs, and intensified insecurity. Climate change has worsened food insecurity in the region, with erratic rainfall and flooding such as the 2024 disaster in Maiduguri displacing thousands and straining infrastructure across northeastern Nigeria.\n\nFluent in English and French, Shola has volunteered with Christian Aid as a data collector, assessing food security among vulnerable households, and with the Initiative for Education and Development (IDEE) as a communications officer and SDG advocate, raising awareness on education, clean water, and sanitation.\n\nA participant in the SDG Cohort 6 Advocacy Program, she is committed to grassroots climate action.\n\nThrough the Lake Chad Climate Justice Youth Fellowship, Shola seeks to amplify community voices, promote resilience, and collaborate with peers to co-create sustainable, locally relevant solutions for the Lake Chad region."
