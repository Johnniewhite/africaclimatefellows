    fullBio: "Shola Rafiat Sule is a climate justice advocate from Biu, Borno State an area transformed into a refuge for displaced persons fleeing conflict from Baga, Chibok, and Maiduguri. This influx has stretched local resources, driven up living costs, and intensified insecurity. Climate change has worsened food insecurity in the region, with erratic rainfall and flooding such as the 2024 disaster in Maiduguri displacing thousands and straining infrastructure across northeastern Nigeria.\n\nFluent in English and French, Shola has volunteered with Christian Aid as a data collector, assessing food security among vulnerable households, and with the Initiative for Education and Development (IDEE) as a communications officer and SDG advocate, raising awareness on education, clean water, and sanitation.\n\nA participant in the SDG Cohort 6 Advocacy Program, she is committed to grassroots climate action.\n\nThrough the Lake Chad Climate Justice Youth Fellowship, Shola seeks to amplify community voices, promote resilience, and collaborate with peers to co-create sustainable, locally relevant solutions for the Lake Chad region."
