About the Fellowship
About the Climate Justice Youth Fellowship
The Climate Justice Youth Fellowship is a transformative initiative dedicated to harnessing the adventurous spirit, resilience, and innovative leadership of African youth. By connecting young climate advocates with critical resources, sharpened skills, professional networks, and international exposure, the Fellowship equips them to lead impactful solutions and drive sustainable change across the continent.
At the heart of this program lies a commitment to addressing climate justice and alleviating the burden of care that disproportionately affects African communities. We recognize the immense potential of Africa’s youth as changemakers and aim to empower them to rise above systemic challenges and amplify their voices on the global stage.
Through tailored capacity-building sessions, mentorship by seasoned experts, research engagements, funding and opportunities to engage in global forums, the Climate Justice Youth Fellowship is more than a program—it is a movement for creating leaders who will shape a resilient and equitable future for Africa.
Mission:
To equip young African climate activists with the tools, networks, funding and mentorship needed to address the intersectional challenges of climate change across the continent.
Vision:
An Africa where empowered youth lead transformative climate action, that delivers justice for individuals and communities.
First Fellowship Call: The Lake Chad Climate Justice Youth Fellowship
Background:
The Lake Chad region faces severe challenges stemming from climate change, including a 90% reduction in the lake's size, leading to desertification, resource scarcity, and the collapse of traditional livelihoods such as agriculture and fishing. These environmental impacts have heightened social tensions, fueled insecurity, and displaced communities, leaving women and girls particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence and exploitation. Youth in the region, though disproportionately affected, are underrepresented in climate action due to barriers like limited resources, inadequate skills, and lack of access to advocacy platforms. Compounding these issues are public health crises, such as waterborne diseases and malnutrition, and systemic global inequities that marginalize these communities in climate justice funding and solutions.
